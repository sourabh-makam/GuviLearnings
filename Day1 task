Difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2

1) Request Multiplexing

In HTTP1.1, there were TCP connection established with the server for a single resource sharing at a time
In HTTP2, in a single TCP conncection multiple parallel requests(inside a stream) are sent asynchronously so that data sharing is much faster.

2) Header Compression

In HTTP1.1 there were headers in the request sent which had to be sent each time when a request to the server is done.
In HTTP2, a header compression strategy is used where the header content which are required for sending the request is 
compressed and for the repeat header content a static dictonary is also used.This way the header size decreases in HTTP2 and web page loads faster

3) Binary Protocol

In HTTP2, the request sent to the server is transformed into binary format which is not human readable, which makes connection secure whereas in HTTP1 a plain text format 
was used to send the request to the server. 

4) Server push

In HTTP2, if the server is configured with server push then with a single request, additional resource files are sent back to the client which makes the entire process faster.
