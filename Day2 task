Difference between Browser JS and NodeJS

1) NodeJS uses a standalone V8 Javascript engine with combination of C++ libraries and some add-ons developed for JS runtime environment.
On the contrary browser JS engine depends on the browser itself as chrome uses V8 engine or Firefox uses spidermonkey.

2) Node JS usage is for backend development whereas BrowserJS usage is for front end development

3) NodeJS has a global object as the root parent whereas BrowserJS has window object as the root parent

4) Both are single threaded execution which means line by line executions.

5) Aysynchronous activites are done by libuv in NodeJS and WebAPI in BrowserJS

6) The thread pool can be configured manually in the nodeJs inside the libuv whereas in the browserJS its configured by the browser IO thread.

7) Module system is commonJS in nodeJS where is in browserJS its ES6(Asynchronous module system(ASM)).

1) Tokenizer - Tokenizer helps in the reading of HTML tags based on the "<" or "</" which helps in forming DOM tree.

2) Speculative parsing - the parser would see ahead than the current execution so as to see if any image, scripts or css are there. As this happens in an another thread
the image would be even downloaded before the parser comes to img tag

3) Render/Frame Tree - This is formed by combining the DOM and CSSOM(HTML and individaul CSS tree structures)

4) Layout process- Traverse the each node in the render tree and lays down each node according to the style and rule.Immedidate layouting 
happens when there is change in font size or browser resize.

5) Paint - creates Renderlayer for the objects. Inline critical CSS is painted first as it speeds up the painting process.
